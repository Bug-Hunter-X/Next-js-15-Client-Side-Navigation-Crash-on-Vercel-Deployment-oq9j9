# Next.js 15 Client-Side Navigation Crash on Vercel

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application deployed to Vercel. The application crashes on client-side navigation, showing a vague error in the browser console and providing no clear indication of the cause.  The issue is not reproducible locally.

## Bug Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Run `npm run start` (or deploy to Vercel).
5. Navigate to a different route within the application (e.g., click a link).

## Expected Behavior

The application should navigate to the new route without crashing.

## Actual Behavior

The application crashes, displaying a vague error message (typically related to a React rendering issue).  The error is difficult to trace and may differ depending on the specific client and Vercel environment.

## Potential Causes

The issue is potentially caused by an interaction between Next.js 15's client-side routing, Vercel's deployment process, and a yet-unknown aspect of the application code or environment.  It could be related to a timing issue, an edge case in the routing system, or a problem with how the client-side data fetching interacts with the server-side rendering.
